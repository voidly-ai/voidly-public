## ðŸ§  What is Voidly?

Voidly is an experimental VPN that uses machine learning to defeat censorship. Every connection you make trains our AI to find better routes around firewalls, blocks, and surveillance.

**The Problem:** Traditional VPNs are losing the arms race against AI-powered censorship. 95% of VPNs are detected by China's Great Firewall. Russia blocks them effortlessly.

**Our Solution:** Fight AI with AI. Train a model that adapts in real-time to censorship patterns.

## ðŸŽ¯ The Mission

Privacy is a human right. We're building infrastructure that:
- **Adapts** - AI learns which routes work in real-time
- **Evolves** - Every connection improves the model
- **Protects** - Helps journalists, activists, and everyone who needs privacy
- **Is Free Forever** - No payment, no signup, no limits

## ðŸ”¬ How It Works

### AI-Powered Routing

Instead of random or static server selection, Voidly uses machine learning to choose the optimal route based on:

- **Your location** (anonymized)
- **Censorship risk scores** (real-time)
- **Historical success rates** from your region
- **Node health and latency**
- **Time-of-day patterns**

See [docs/ai-routing.md](docs/ai-routing.md) for technical details.
