# Roadmap

Current status and planned development for the Voidly censorship research platform.

## Current Status (February 2026)

### Data Coverage
- 11.7M live OONI measurements across 119 countries
- 1.6M historical records (10-year OONI archive)
- 5,356+ documented censorship incidents with evidence
- 16,822 evidence items from 4 data sources
- Ingestion every 30 minutes from OONI, CensoredPlanet, IODA

### Intelligence Products
- **Censorship Index** — Live country rankings with composite scores
- **Incident Database** — Citable incidents with human-readable IDs (IR-2026-0142)
- **Claim Verification** — Natural language fact-checking against evidence
- **Domain Risk** — Per-domain blocking status across all countries
- **7-Day Forecast** — Shutdown risk predictions
- **Platform Risk** — Per-platform censorship scores (12 platforms)
- **ISP Risk Index** — ISP-level censorship scoring
- **Service Accessibility** — Real-time "can users access X in Y?" oracle
- **Election Briefings** — Election-censorship correlation analysis
- **Real-Time Alerts** — Webhook notifications for new incidents

### AI Integrations
- MCP Server with 27 tools (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf)
- ChatGPT Action

- llms.txt for LLM discovery
- RSS/Atom feeds for real-time syndication

### Community
- 16-node probe network across multiple countries
- Open-source community probe client
- CC BY 4.0 data licensing

## What's Next

### Academic Partnerships
- Collaborate with university research groups
- Publish peer-reviewed methodology paper
- Integrate into academic censorship measurement workflows

### Expanded Probe Network
- Grow community probe network to 50+ nodes
- Add more countries with limited OONI coverage
- Improve geographic diversity of measurements

### Data Quality
- Expand CensoredPlanet coverage to more countries
- Improve domain categorization coverage
- Add more OONI test types as they become available
- Reduce false positive rate in edge cases

### Citation & Impact
- Get cited by journalists and researchers
- Track citation count across academic papers
