## What We're NOT Ready For (Yet)

### ‚ùå Code Contributions
We're not accepting pull requests yet because:
- Core infrastructure is still changing rapidly
- No stable API to build against
- Most code is not open sourced yet (coming in Phase 2+)

**When Phase 3 begins (mid-2025), we'll open up code contributions.**

### ‚ùå Running Your Own Node
Community nodes are planned for Phase 5, but not ready yet.
